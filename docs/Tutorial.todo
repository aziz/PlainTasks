How to Use PlainTasks:

Projects:
 ☐ Anything with colon at the end of the line is a project title
 ☐ You can nest projects inside each other
 ☐ You can fold projects (a built-in editor feature)

Tasks:
  You can write plain text as _notes_ or descriptions wherever you want;
  it's **totally** fine!
  New:
   ☐ Press ⌘+enter (ctrl+enter on Windows) to add a new task.
   ☐ You can also use ⌘+i (ctrl+i on Windows) to add new task
   ☐ If you're on a new line PlainTasks will create a new task on the current line
   ☐ If you're on a line with a task pressing new task shortcut will add a task after it
   ☐ If you're on a line with some normal text pressing new task shortcut will convert it to a task
   ☐ New tasks will be nested as much as the task on the previous line
  Done:
   ☐ Pressing ⌘+d (ctrl+d on Windows) mark a task as done
   ☐ Pressing ⌘+d (ctrl+d on Windows) again will put it back in pending mode
   ☐ Pressing ctrl+c (alt+c on Windows) will mark the task as cancelled
  Tagging:
   ☐ You can add tags using @ sign, like this @tag
  URLs:
   ☐ Pressing ⌘+shift+U (ctrl+shift+U on Windows) will open the url under the cursor in your default browser
  File links:
   ☐ You can create a link to a file within your project by prefixing the file name with a dot and (back)slash sign like: .\filename\
    ./another filename/ it supports only one filename per line
   ☐ The line and column can be specified by colons: .\filename:11:8
   ☐ In SublimeText 3 you can specify a symbol inside that file by using > character like: .\filename>symbol
   ☐ In SublimeText 2 you can specify a text inside that file by using inch characters like: .\filename"any text"
   ☐ Pressing ctrl+o (alt+o on Windows) will open the file in Sublime

  Archiving:
   ☐ Pressing ⌘+shift+A (ctrl+shift+A on Windows) will archive the done task.
      By removing them from your list and appending them to the bottom of the file under Archive project.
      The archive project is separated from the other list of projects with a line. see bottom of this file.

  Starting a new todo-list:
   ☐ Bring up the command palette (it's ⌘+shift+p in Mac and ctrl+shift+p in Windows)
   ☐ type `task` and select `Tasks: New document` command

--- ✄ -----------------------
You can use separator snippet to separate your todo lists, type -- and press tab
Couple of tags are in completion rules:
  ☐ type s, press tab key twice — it'll become @started(13-10-25 15:20)
    you'll get a current date;
    when a task with such tag is completed/cancelled, you'll know how many time has passed since start.
  ☐ type t, press tab key — it'll become @today
    easy to spot, eh?

FileType Support:
 PlainTasks support these file types out of the box
 ☐ TODO
 ☐ *.todo
 ☐ *.todolist
 ☐ *.taskpaper
 ☐ *.tasks

You can customize:
 ☐ New and done bullets
 ☐ List of file-types that should be considered todo lists
 ☐ Key-bindings if you don't like the default ones
 ☐ Date formating for done tasks
 See the readme file on github on how to do these customizations. https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks

Editor Useful Tools:
 ☐ Use ⌘+control+up/down (ctrl+shift+up/down on Windows) to move tasks up and down.
 ☐ Use ⌘+R (ctrl+R on Windows) to see a list of projects and quickly jump between them
